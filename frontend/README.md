## My Contributions  

I worked on the **frontend** of the project, focusing on building a user-friendly and visually appealing interface. My key contributions include:  

### **Authentication Pages**  
Developed the **Login** and **Sign-Up** pages.  

#### **Sign-Up Page**  
The sign-up process was divided into **two steps** to improve user experience:  

- **Step 1**: Requires **username, email, and password**
